# 1. Introduction

## Problem Statement

This project aims to solve the dual challenges of ensuring data reliability and protecting the privacy of location information and related data generated by IoT devices (especially drones). Specifically, we are addressing the following issues:

* **Location Privacy Risks:** The risk of exposing personal behavioral history and confidential information when raw location data collected by devices is made public.

* **Data Reliability Issues:** The difficulty of verifying that collected location information has not been tampered with, and ensuring the transparency of the verification process itself.

* **Verification Costs in Decentralized Systems:** The high transaction costs and scalability limitations when recording data on Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLT) like blockchains.

## Background (Social and Technical Challenges)

With the rapid adoption of drones and other IoT devices in recent years, a massive amount of data is being generated. While this data—particularly location information—is utilized in various fields such as logistics, surveillance, and autonomous driving, concerns regarding its accuracy and privacy protection are growing. Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) is an innovative technology that allows one to prove the truth of an assertion without revealing the specific contents of the information. It is expected to be a powerful solution to these challenges.

## Why This Project is Necessary

By applying ZKP technology to IoT data verification, this project enables the following:

* **Private Proofs:** Proving that a drone was at a specific location or followed a specific route without disclosing detailed latitude and longitude information.

* **Tamper Resistance:** Guaranteeing the authenticity and immutability of data by recording ZKPs on the blockchain.

* **Efficient Verification:** Reducing on-chain verification costs by verifying ZKPs via smart contracts while processing complex data off-chain.

## Target Use Cases

* **Drone Flight Path Auditing:** Proving to third parties that a drone flew in a specific area while keeping the exact path private.

* **Ensuring Supply Chain Transparency:** Proving the location of packages in logistics using ZKP to enhance tracking reliability.

* **IoT Device Authentication:** Strengthening security by proving that a device is physically present in a specific location.

# 2. Overview / Abstract

## System Summary

This system is an end-to-end solution composed of a Flutter-based mobile client application and a Node.js-based backend server. It uses Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) technology to verify the reliability of location information from IoT devices (drones) and records the proof on a blockchain. Based on the location data acquired by the client, the server generates a ZKP, cross-references it with drone data stored on IPFS, and permanently records the result on the blockchain.

* Image capture via camera

* Location tracking and history management via GPS

* Drone ID detection via Bluetooth LE

* Local Poseidon hash generation based on acquired data and performance evaluation (benchmarking)

**Backend Server (Node.js):**

## Data Flow

1. **Data Acquisition (Client: `lib/main.dart`):** The mobile client captures an image via the camera (`_controller.takePicture()`), acquires GPS location data (`_location.onLocationChanged.listen`), and detects a specific drone ID (`_targetDroneId`) via Bluetooth LE (`FlutterBluePlus.scanResults.listen`).

2. **Local Processing (Client: `lib/main.dart`):** Based on the location data and capture time, the `_generateAllHashes` function generates Poseidon hashes across multiple time windows and benchmarks the performance. The results are saved to SQLite using `LocalDatabaseHelper.instance.createRecord`.

3. **Server Submission (Client: `lib/main.dart` -> Server: `server.cjs`):** The client sends the image file (`imageXFile.path`), drone ID, and generated hashes to the backend server's `/submit` endpoint using an `http.MultipartRequest` inside the `_submitApplication` function.

4. **Server-side Data Storage (Server: `server.cjs`):** The server's `/submit` endpoint receives the data via the multer middleware and temporarily stores it in the `uploads/` directory. The submission status is recorded in `submission-status.json` via the `updateSubmissionStatus` function.

5. **IPFS Upload (Server: `server.cjs`):** Inside the `/submit` endpoint, the entire submitted directory is uploaded to IPFS using `ipfs.addAll`, and its CID is recorded via `updateSubmissionStatus`.

6. **IPFS Watcher (Server: `server.cjs`):** The `startIpfsWatcher` function allows the server to periodically monitor IPFS/IPNS to detect data updates related to specific drone IDs based on `ipns-names.json`. The `ipfs/retrieve-data.mjs` script is called as an external process.

7. **ZKP Generation (Server: `server.cjs`):** When an update is detected by the IPFS watcher, the `processAllSubmissions` function is executed. This function generates Circom inputs (`input.json`) via the `prepareInputs` function, using the drone data retrieved from IPFS and the hashes submitted by the client (read from `user_data.json`). Then, `child_process.execSync` is used to calculate the Witness (`witness.wtns` via `snarkjs wtns calculate`) and generate the Groth16 proof (`proof.json`, `public.json` via `snarkjs groth16 prove`).

8. **Blockchain Recording (Server: `server.cjs`):** Within the `processAllSubmissions` function, the generated ZKP's public inputs and proof (calldata generated by `snarkjs zkey export soliditycalldata`) are recorded on the Ethereum Sepolia blockchain through a deployed smart contract (`contract.recordProof`) using ethers.js. A transaction hash is issued, and the submission status is updated.

## Component Description

* **Mobile App (Flutter):** Uses `lib/main.dart` as the entry point, providing the UI for camera/GPS/BLE data collection in `CameraScreen` (`_CameraScreenState`), local record management in `LocalHistoryScreen`, and the ZKP submission flow in `VerificationScreen`. The `LocalDatabaseHelper` class abstracts the SQLite database.

* **Backend Server (Node.js):** Uses `server.cjs` as the entry point and defines API endpoints with express. Processes file uploads with multer and executes external ZKP tools (snarkjs) using `child_process`. Communicates with the blockchain via ethers.js (`contract`).

* **Blockchain (Ethereum Sepolia):** A smart contract (ABI defined as `CONTRACT_ABI`) deployed at the address specified in `deployed-address.json` permanently records ZKP verification results through the `recordProof` function.

* **ZKP Circuit (Circom/snarkjs):** Executed by the snarkjs command-line tool on the server. It uses `./merkle_js/merkle.wasm` (for Witness calculation) and `merkle_final.zkey` (for Groth16 proof generation) to generate a zero-knowledge proof proving that the provided inputs satisfy specific conditions. ZKP inputs are formatted by the `prepareInputs` function (`./prepare_inputs.js`).

* **IPFS (InterPlanetary File System):** Connects to an IPFS node via the `ipfs-http-client` library. Uploads contents of the `uploads/` directory to IPFS and monitors specific drone data updates using `ipns-names.json` and `ipfs/retrieve-data.mjs`.
